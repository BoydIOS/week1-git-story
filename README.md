### Setup git on local environment
***Windows only***: 
On Windows, you will need to run these commands from git bash ([Git Bash download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).


1. **Link your github to your local environment**  
  See: [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

    Or complete these steps in order:  
    - [Checking for existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)  
    - [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)   (The section about "Generating a new SSH key" and the section "Adding your SSH key to the ssh-agent")

2. **Add your git `email` and `username` to your local environment**
